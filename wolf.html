    <h2>Etymology </h2>
    <p>The English "wolf" stems from the Old English wulf, which is itself thought to be derived from the Proto-Germanic
        *wulfaz. The Proto-Indo-European root *wĺ̥kʷos may also be the source of the Latin word for the animal lupus
        (*lúkʷos).[5][6] The name "gray wolf" refers to the grayish colour of the species.[7]

        Since pre-Christian times, Germanic peoples such as the Anglo-Saxons took on wulf as a prefix or suffix in their
        names. Examples include Wulfhere ("Wolf Army"), Cynewulf ("Royal Wolf"), Cēnwulf ("Bold Wolf"), Wulfheard
        ("Wolf-hard"), Earnwulf ("Eagle Wolf"), Wulfstān ("Wolf Stone") Æðelwulf ("Noble Wolf"), Wolfhroc
        ("Wolf-Frock"), Wolfhetan ("Wolf Hide"), Scrutolf ("Garb Wolf"), Wolfgang ("Wolf Gait") and Wolfdregil ("Wolf
        Runner").[8]</p>

    <H2>Taxonomy</H2>
    <P>In 1758, the Swedish botanist and zoologist Carl Linnaeus published in his Systema Naturae the binomial
        nomenclature.[4] Canis is the Latin word meaning "dog",[10] and under this genus he listed the doglike
        carnivores including domestic dogs, wolves, and jackals. He classified the domestic dog as Canis familiaris, and
        the wolf as Canis lupus.[4] Linnaeus considered the dog to be a separate species from the wolf because of its
        "cauda recurvata" (upturning tail) which is not found in any other canid.[11]</P>
    <H3>Subspecies</H3>
    <P>In the third edition of Mammal Species of the World published in 2005, the mammalogist W. Christopher Wozencraft
        listed under C. lupus 36 wild subspecies, and proposed two additional subspecies: familiaris (Linnaeus, 1758)
        and dingo (Meyer, 1793). Wozencraft included hallstromi—the New Guinea singing dog—as a taxonomic synonym for
        the dingo. Wozencraft referred to a 1999 mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) study as one of the guides in forming his
        decision, and listed the 38 subspecies of C. lupus under the biological common name of "wolf", the nominate
        subspecies being the Eurasian wolf (C. l. lupus) based on the type specimen that Linnaeus studied in Sweden.[12]
        Studies using paleogenomic techniques reveal that the modern wolf and the dog are sister taxa, as modern wolves
        are not closely related to the population of wolves that was first domesticated.[13] In 2019, a workshop hosted
        by the IUCN/Species Survival Commission's Canid Specialist Group considered the New Guinea singing dog and the
        dingo to be feral Canis familiaris, and therefore should not be assessed for the IUCN Red List.[14]</P>
    <H3>Evolution</H3>
    The phylogenetic descent of the extant wolf C. lupus from C. etruscus through C. mosbachensis is widely
    accepted.[15] The earliest fossils of C. lupus were found in what was once eastern Beringia at Old Crow, Yukon,
    Canada, and at Cripple Creek Sump, Fairbanks, Alaska. The age is not agreed upon but could date to one million years
    ago. Considerable morphological diversity existed among wolves by the Late Pleistocene. They had more robust skulls
    and teeth than modern wolves, often with a shortened snout, a pronounced development of the temporalis muscle, and
    robust premolars. It is proposed that these features were specialized adaptations for the processing of carcass and
    bone associated with the hunting and scavenging of Pleistocene megafauna. Compared with modern wolves, some
    Pleistocene wolves showed an increase in tooth breakage similar to that seen in the extinct dire wolf. This suggests
    they either often processed carcasses, or that they competed with other carnivores and needed to consume their prey
    quickly. Compared with those found in the modern spotted hyena, the frequency and location of tooth fractures in
    these wolves indicates they were habitual bone crackers.[16]

    Genomic studies suggest modern wolves and dogs descend from a common ancestral wolf population[17][18][19] that
    existed 20,000 years ago.[17] A 2021 study found that the Himalayan wolf and the Indian plains wolf are part of a
    lineage that is basal to other wolves and split from them 200,000 years ago.[20] Other wolves appear to have
    originated in Beringia in an expansion that was driven by the huge ecological changes during the close of the Late
    Pleistocene.[21] A study in 2016 indicates that a population bottleneck was followed by a rapid radiation from an
    ancestral population at a time during, or just after, the Last Glacial Maximum. This implies the original
    morphologically diverse wolf populations were out-competed and replaced by more modern wolves.[22]

    A 2016 genomic study suggests that Old World and New World wolves split around 12,500 years ago followed by the
    divergence of the lineage that led to dogs from other Old World wolves around 11,100–12,300 years ago.[19] An
    extinct Late Pleistocene wolf may have been the ancestor of the dog,[23][16] with the dog's similarity to the extant
    wolf being the result of genetic admixture between the two.[16] The dingo, Basenji, Tibetan Mastiff and Chinese
    indigenous breeds are basal members of the domestic dog clade. The divergence time for wolves in Europe, the Middle
    East, and Asia is estimated to be fairly recent at around 1,600 years ago. Among New World wolves, the Mexican wolf
    diverged around 5,400 years ago.[19]

    <p>he wolf is the largest extant member of the Canidae family,[31] and is further distinguished from coyotes and
        jackals by a broader snout, shorter ears, a shorter torso and a longer tail.[32][31] It is slender and
        powerfully built, with a large, deeply descending rib cage, a sloping back, and a heavily muscled neck.[33] The
        wolf's legs are moderately longer than those of other canids, which enables the animal to move swiftly, and to
        overcome the deep snow that covers most of its geographical range in winter.[34] The ears are relatively small
        and triangular.[33] The wolf's head is large and heavy, with a wide forehead, strong jaws and a long, blunt
        muzzle.[35] The skull is 230–280 mm (9–11 in) in length and 130–150 mm (5–6 in) in width.[36] The teeth are
        heavy and large, making them better suited to crushing bone than those of other canids. They are not as
        specialized as those found in hyenas though.[37][38] Its molars have a flat chewing surface, but not to the same
        extent as the coyote, whose diet contains more vegetable matter.[39] Females tend to have narrower muzzles and
        foreheads, thinner necks, slightly shorter legs, and less massive shoulders than males.[40]</p>
